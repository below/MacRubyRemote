MacRubyRemote

this is just a proof of concept, very rough around the edges. But it works.
You need MacRuby 0.5 and you need to install sinatra like this
sudo macgem install sinatra

then build and run the xcode app and then open the index.html in SpyClient directory.

You can watch a video of it in action here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8mq8tit1sg

Enjoy.
